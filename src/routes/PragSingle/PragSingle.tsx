			<q>Prag</q> (en: <q>Prague</q>) is the first single I released. It is an
			instrumental song featuring heavy electric guitars and drums, with an
			atmospheric progressive rock/metal sound. It is inspired by the cold and
			foggy atmosphere around Prague&apos;s riverside and hills during winter.
