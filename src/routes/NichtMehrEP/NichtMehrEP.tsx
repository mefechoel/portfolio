			<q>Nicht Mehr</q> (en: <q>Not any more</q>) is the first EP I released. It
			features three instrumental songs. The sounds are a blend of electronic
			instruments, organic samples, synthesizers, electric guitar and acoustic
			and electronic drums. To my ears, the EP has a relaxed, atmospheric indie
			vibe.
